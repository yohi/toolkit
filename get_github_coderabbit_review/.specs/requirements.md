# Requirements Document

## Overview

Develop a Python script that fetches CodeRabbit comment content from GitHub pull request URLs and formats them. This tool aims to efficiently collect and organize automatic review comments from CodeRabbit, making it easier for developers to understand review content.

## CodeRabbit Comment Sample Structure

The following are examples of actual CodeRabbit comment structures:

### Summary Comment Example
```
## Summary by CodeRabbit

‚Ä¢ New Features
  ‚Ä¢ Added key storage with AWS Secrets Manager as backend.

‚Ä¢ Documentation
  ‚Ä¢ Added README regarding hook disabling.

‚Ä¢ Tests
  ‚Ä¢ Added unit/integration tests to verify CRUD, metadata, listing, size limits, and uninitialized behavior.

## Walkthrough

Added new AWS Secrets Manager backend for Rundeck. Implemented initialization, save, retrieve, update, delete, list, metadata retrieval, and cleanup processes.

## Changes

| Cohort / File(s) | Summary |
|------------------|---------|
| Docs aws-keystorage-plugin/README.md | Added new README (1 line: "# pre-push hook disabled"). |
| Secrets Manager Backend Implementation | Added new SecretsManagerBackend class. |
```

### Review Comment Example
```
Actionable comments posted: 8

üßπ Nitpick comments (2)
aws-keystorage-plugin/src/main/java/.../SecretsManagerBackend.java (2)

541-545 : Recovery window for deletion is hardcoded

Recovery window is hardcoded to 7 days. Should be configurable.

ü§ñ Prompt for AI Agents

+private static final int DEFAULT_RECOVERY_WINDOW_DAYS = 7;
+private int recoveryWindowDays;
+
+// In initialize method:
+this.recoveryWindowDays = configManager.getInteger("sm-recovery-window-days", DEFAULT_RECOVERY_WINDOW_DAYS);

‚ö†Ô∏è Outside diff range comments

aws-keystorage-plugin/src/main/java/.../SecretsManagerBackend.java (1)

823-824 : isDirectChild method implementation is accurate

Correctly determines direct child elements of parent path. Edge cases are properly handled.
```
